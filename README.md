## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions 'til "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

First, you will need to install necessary dependencies. Run the following command from the _root_ of the project to install JavaScript dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Once the JavaScript dependencies are installed, run the following commands to install native iOS dependencies:

```bash
cd ios
bundle exec pod install
```

### Step 2: Start the Metro Server

Once all dependencies are installed, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native. Run the following command from the _root_ of the project to start Metro:

```bash
npm start
```

### Step 3: Start the Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of the project. Run the following command to start the _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
npm run android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
npm run ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see the app running in the _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run the app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Formatting

Code formatting is managed by [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

Check that the code adherees to the formatting standards with the following command:

```bash
npm run check-format
```

Format violations automatically with the following command:

```bash
npm run format
```

## Linting

Linting is managed by [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

Check for violations with the following command:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Testing

Automated tests are run via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

Run tests with the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Type-checking

Type-checking is powered by [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

Check for type violations with the following command:

```bash
npm run tsc
```

## Troubleshooting

### iOS

If you run into the following error while trying to build the project with Xcode,

```
React-rncore: PhaseScriptExecution failed with nonzero exit code
```

ensure a _ios/.xcode.env.local_ file exists which exports the path to your Node.js binary.

```bash
export NODE_BINARY="/path/to/node"
```

### Other

If you run into issues, check out the [React Native troubleshooting](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting) page.

## Thoughts

### On Additional Pokemon Details

Each new search query submission currently makes a request to both the `/pokemon` and `/pokemon-species` endpoints on the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) in parallel, combining the results to provide the Pokemon ID, name, and front-facing sprite. Additonal details could be added with the following steps:

- Add a field for the detail to the `src/pokemon/Pokemon` type
- Update `src/pokemon/gateway/NetworkPokemonGatewayImpl#byName` to grab the value from either the `/pokemon` or `/pokemon-species` response
- Update `src/pokemon/ui/PokemonView` to render the detail
- Stub the value from the `/pokemon` or `/pokemon-species` response in the mocked successtul response in `src/ui/App/App.test`

### On Considerations for Concurrent Environment

A concurrent environment is assumed to mean one in which (many) users are interacting with the mobile application in parallel. In this type of environment, limiting unnecessary traffic is paramount to allow the backend to scale. Unnecessary traffic could be pruned by:

- Validating, solely in the mobile application, search queries that are destined to fail (e.g., blank queries)
- Caching Pokemon details to disk on the mobile device with a generous expiration, assuming the details do not change frequently
- Having the mobile application communicate with a proxy for the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), rather than directly, with its own cache, allowing the backend to scale independently
